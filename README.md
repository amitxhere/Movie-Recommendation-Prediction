# Movie-Recommendation-Prediction
Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Machine Learning. This project uses content-based filtering with TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on genres, keywords, cast, and director. Fuzzy matching is implemented to handle user input errors and improve recommendation accuracy.
